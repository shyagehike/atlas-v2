# ATLAS v2 - Global Landslide Prediction with a Random Fourier Features + Log-Gaussian Cox Process Model
An open-source early-warning framework for near-real-time landslide risk prediction to prevent landslide fatalities around the world 

## The Problem(s)
Every year, landslides kill over 4,500 people globally, with developing nations bearing a large fraction of casualties despite having the fewest resources for prediction, prevention, and relief.
This project develops an RFF LGCP model that can predict landslides at an hourly cadence using limited data, specifically designed for deployment in resource-constrainted regions of the world (namely, sub-Saharan Africa)

Current landslide prediction systems often fail or have limited utility in real-world deployment because they:
- require massive amounts of high-quality data, which doesn't exist in vulnerable regions
- ignore temporal effects that can accumulate over weeks
- can't handle uncertain or missing location data
- need heavy computational resources to run
- generate too many false alarms, causing warning fatigue

## Key Innovations
1. Continuous Spatial Probability Fields (dropped a grid based approach in favor of modeling landslide risk as a continuous probabilistic distribution through log-gaussian cox processes parametrized via RFFs, saving parameters and allowing us to query risk at any location)
3. Uncertainty-Aware Training (the model explicitly accounts for coordinate, labeling, & temporal uncertainties by weighting certain samples rather than discarding them, expanding usable training data and improving redundancy to real-world noise)
4. Multi-Resolution Fusion (allows the elegant combination of data at different spatial resolutions without information loss (resolution invariance))
5. Computational Efficiency & Transparency (training completes in under 8 hours on standard hardware; localized inference runs in under a minute + all data sources are open and freely accessible via primarily Google Earth Engine)

## Extra Notes

In 2023, I witnessed the aftermath of heavy rains in East Africa that triggered flooding and landslides in Northwestern Rwanda, among other places, destroying nearly 6 thousand homes (damaging 2.5 thousand extra), 26 bridges, over a dozen roads, a dozen power stations, eight water treatment plants, five health centers, and a hospital. 130 people died as well as thousands of livestock. These historically unusual rainfall patterns can largely be attributed to climate change, according to Rwanda's local weather authority. See:
